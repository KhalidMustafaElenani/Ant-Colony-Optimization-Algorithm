## Description
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. ACO is a stochastic, population-based optimization method inspired by the behavior of real ant colonies. It simulates the actions of ants to solve discrete optimization problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and other NP-hard problems.

The ACO algorithm uses a set of software agents (ants) to explore possible solutions. It has been widely successful in various optimization tasks, including vehicle routing, network routing, and assembly line balancing.
