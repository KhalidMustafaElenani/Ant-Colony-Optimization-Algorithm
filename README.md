## Description
* This repository provides a Python implementation of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm for solving various optimization problems. \
* Inspired by the foraging behavior of ants, the algorithm constructs solutions iteratively by moving through a solution space and leveraging pheromone levels. The algorithm converges towards optimal or near-optimal solutions by utilizing both local and global information.

## Installation
* To use the ACO algorithm, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

## Contributing
* Feel free to fork this repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests. Your contributions are welcome!
