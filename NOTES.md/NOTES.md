# ACO Algorithm Notes

## ACO Overview
- **State Transition Probability**:
  - Formula:
    ```
    P(i, j)_k = (τ(i, j)^α × η(i, j)^β) / ∑(τ(i, j)^α × η(i, j)^β)
    ```
    where:
    - `α` and `β` are heuristic constants.
    - `τ(i, j)` is the amount of pheromone on the path from city `i` to city `j`.
    - `η(i, j)` is the heuristic information, typically the inverse of the distance (`η(i, j) = 1 / d(i, j)`).

- **Pheromone Update**:
  - **Reinforcement**:
    - Formula:
      ```
      τ(i, j)_new = τ(i, j)_old + Δτ(i, j)
      ```
      where:
      ```
      Δτ(i, j) = Q / Tour Length
      ```
      `Q` is the total amount of pheromone.
  - **Evaporation**:
    - Formula:
      ```
      τ(i, j)_new = (1 - ρ) × τ(i, j)_old
      ```
      where `ρ` is the pheromone decay rate.

- **Characteristics of Ants as Agents**:
  - Ants communicate via chemical trails (pheromone).
  - Decision-making is based on pheromone strength and distance.
  - Paths represent candidate solutions.
  - After completing a solution, ants deposit pheromone based on the quality of the solution.
  - Influence on other ants through "stigmergy."

## How it Works
1. **Initialization**: Set up initial pheromone levels.
2. **Ant Movement and Solution Construction**:
   - Place an ant randomly at a node.
   - Construct a solution (path) based on pheromone levels and heuristic information.
3. **State Transition Probability**:
   - Formula:
     ```
     P(i, j)^k = (τ(i, j)^α × η(i, j)^β) / ∑(τ(i, j)^α × η(i, j)^β)
     ```
4. **Pheromone Update**:
   - Reinforce pheromone based on solution quality:
     ```
     τ(i, j)^new = τ(i, j)^old + Δτ(i, j)
     ```
   - Update pheromone:
     ```
     Δτ(i, j) = Q / Tour Length
     ```
5. **Pheromone Evaporation**:
   - Gradually reduce pheromone levels:
     ```
     τ(i, j)^new = (1 - ρ) × τ(i, j)_old
     ```
   - `ρ` is the pheromone decay rate.
6. **Termination Condition**: Check if a predefined stopping criterion is met.
7. **Iteration**: Repeat steps 2 to 6 until the termination condition is satisfied.
8. **Solution Retrieval**: The best solution found by the ants is considered the final output.

## Applications
- Vehicle routing with time window constraints
- Network routing problems
- Assembly line balancing

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure pheromone levels are correctly initialized and updated.
- Verify that state transition probabilities are calculated accurately.
- Check pheromone evaporation rates to ensure proper simulation of pheromone decay.
